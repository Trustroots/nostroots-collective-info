# Trustroots Collective

## When

Wednesday 22nd to Sunday 26th of May 2024.
Feel free to arrive a day or three beforehand.

## Where

1 hour train ride from Berlin. Precise details shared with participants.

## Why

In 2022 the main person behind Trustroots stepped away from the project, without even a message. This came very close to killing the whole project. From this we realised that all hospitality networks seem to fail because of their leadership. In response, we came up with an ambitious mission to move away from a single organisation and a single web site and make trustroots into something else. Instead of just one site with all the data and control, several sites with the data, and users in full control of their data.

Is that really possible? Well, it's definitely ambitious, but we think we can make this happen with nostr. If you're interested in the technical nuts and bolts, you [can read more about that here](https://github.com/Trustroots/nostroots).

## What

We're hosting a collective. A shared working session. There will be a few things happening:

- Some technical software work to move this mission forwards
- Writing and other creative works to help communicate this weird and whacky vision
- General organising, meal preparation, shared meeting facilitation, and so on

We're lookng for volunteers to help with all of the above. If you'd like to volunteer for non technical contributions, [please apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxRT3xiJk-1e2EpAuc6wepWcF9sFZ5xb8jRIs_9cuMzr44bw/viewform?usp=sf_link).

Technical focused volunteers are invited to apply [here](https://github.com/trustroots/nostroots/issues/11).

## Questions

If you have any questions which are not covered here, feel free to email support@trustroots.org and we'll get back to you. Please be advised it might take a little while for us to reply.
